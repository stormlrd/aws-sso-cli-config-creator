Are you using AWS CLI v2 with AWS SSO

Sick and tired of having to run aws sso configure --profile myprofilename for each role you have?

Or perhaps sick of just copying and pasting and editing rolenames manually in the config?

This script will **scrape** your roles from AWS SSO and create a AWS CLI v2 config file for you.

# Usage:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the source_config, tweak the configuration to your SSO and primary account/role then save it
3. Copy & paste the source_config contents into your .aws\config file
4. Login to AWS SSO using aws sso login --profile primary
5. execute the script using py create_config.py
6. Transfer contents of config.new into your .aws\config file

Enjoy a long life.

# Dependancies
The script relies on a couple of things:

1. That you have already logged into AWS SSO using aws sso login --profile primary.
2. That you have configured your source_config file before running it
3. The the inital primary role you've specific has permissions to read from AWS SSO using list_account_roles() & list_accounts()
4. That you have aws cli v2 installed, python3 installed and boto3 library installed for python.

The initial login to aws sso requires that you have set up at least one profile in your config file for the aws cli. refer to the usage instructions.

# TroubleShooting:
If you get this error:

	*botocore.errorfactory.UnauthorizedException: An error occurred (UnauthorizedException) when calling the ListAccounts operation: Session token not found or invalid*

do an aws sso login again. the token has expired. I tried to write a check for this but there is a bug in the timestamp that the AWS CLI v2 writes out.
